    Login and authentication work
    the redirect page isnt setup so it errors out

  Fixed:
    routing so that upon login goes to welcome component was redirecting to login prior
    added header component for login logout and username to show


  To Do:
    Setup unique jks file for pw encryption
    setup actual mailserver to send out confirm emails
    Setup up a service to pull rides from backend

November 2 2021
  Status
    redirect page fixed set to welcome page
    park and ride components and services set to the right api endpoints and use correct models

    the site pulls date from the db i can see parks and rides this shit is dope
    endpoint auth configure for new api controllers allowing all parks and rides to be viewed without authorization

  To Do's

    Set constant variables in angular for the base url and set the services to use the value so that external user can access the appropriate
    api endpoint address not... localhost

    regex to pull from title (?<=(<title>))(\w|\d|\n|[().,\-:;@#$%^&*\[\]"'+–/\/®°⁰!?{}|`~]| )+?(?=(</title>))
    after dash
    (?<= - ).*
    before dash
    .*(?= - )

    merge data into the right tables
      insert parks into park table:
        INSERT INTO CTrackerApp.park (park_name)
        SELECT distinct park_name FROM CTrackerApp.rcdbpage;

      insert parks with proper location
        select distinct a.park_name, city, a.state, a.country from CTrackerApp.rcdbpage a where country is not null


      pull rides along with corresponding ids
        SELECT a.ride, b.id FROM CTrackerApp.rcdbpage a
        JOIN CTrackerApp.park b on a.park_name = b.park_name;

      insert rides into ride table with park id
        INSERT INTO CTrackerApp.ride (name, park_id)

  Added notes to fronted 
  detailed steps to copy data
  troubleshot backend sql queries

  Copying projects
    Frontend:
      ng build

    Backend 
      mvn clean install
      scp <project dir>/CTracker/target/CTracker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  root@192.168.0.130:/media/Dookalator/

  fixed sql statements on park repository so that city state and country pull properly from front end
